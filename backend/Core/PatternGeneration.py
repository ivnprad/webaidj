    """
    Generates a playlist from a dictionary of songs with their BPM (Beats Per Minute).

    The function sorts the input songs by BPM, then creates a playlist starting from a random 
    song among the ten with the lowest BPM. It gradually adds songs to the playlist, ensuring 
    each subsequent song has a BPM slightly higher (between 2.5 to 7 BPM more) than the last. 
    The process stops when it reaches the song with the highest BPM in the input or when no 
    suitable songs are left to maintain the BPM range progression.

    Parameters:
    - songData (dict): A dictionary where keys are song names and values are their BPM.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of song names representing the generated playlist.

    Note:
    - The function assumes songData contains more than 10 songs; behavior is undefined otherwise.
    - Uses random selection, so output can vary in different calls.
    - Includes TODOs for future improvements: checking size of songData and modifying sortedSongsBeat subspan.

    Example:
    songData = {"Song A": 120, "Song B": 110, ...}
    playlist = FirstGenerativePattern(songData)
    print("Generated Playlist:", playlist)
